    "Ans:\n",

    "   To draw a line glyph to a figure, we use the line() method of the figure object.In order to add the circle glyph to our plot, we use the circle() method . Similarly, we can render bars using vbar() function for vertical bars and hbar() function for horizontal bars and so on.\n",
